This blog has been reunited with the mothership and lives at https://lengstorf.com/code/ now.

Content is at https://github.com/jlengstorf/lengstorf.com. The blog source lives in the [Gatsby theme for my site](https://github.com/jlengstorf/gatsby-theme-jason-blog).

All thatâ€™s here now is a set of [redirects for Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/docs/redirects/).
