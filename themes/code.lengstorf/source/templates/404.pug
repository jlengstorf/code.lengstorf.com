    p There are two reasons why you might be seeing this page:
    ol
      li I haven't created any posts in the category you just clicked on (I'm working on it, scout’s honor!), or
      li There was a typo in the URL that you entered/clicked.
    p If it’s the latter, and you clicked on a link from somewhere else, please 
      a(href="mailto:jason@lengstorf.com") send me an email
      |  and let me know where you were and what you clicked, so I can fix the problem.
